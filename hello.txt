Testing Git Setup

If you are starting A NEW PROJECT

step 1 
create the project in Github repository and choose add Readme.txt

Step 2 
in git bash go to the folder you want your project to be in and use the clone command 

-- Git clone < link of the project from git her > 

-- this should set up the project for you withought a problem 

Step 3 
After writing your code you can now use Git add
-- git add * 

Step 4 
after adding the files then use git commit 
-- git commit -m " added some files " 

step 5 
now that the files are added and commited now we can push the changed files to git repository with git push 

-- git push -u 

Now this should set up your project in a Github Repository after any changes 

repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 

                ADDING AN EXISTING PROJECT

git add * or -A for all and "file.html" for direct

git commit -m "drawing a line and commenting what you have done "

git remote add origin https://github.com/project.git -----> adding the git repository link if not cloned or if you don't have one 

git push -u origin master ----> adding all the files to git Repository
